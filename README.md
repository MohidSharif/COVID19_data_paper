This repository contains an R project for my research paper on "Reducing the Risk of COVID-19 for Vulnerable ages".

COVID-19 has taken over the world for more than two years now and it is important to study and understand in which circumstances cases rise and fall. I studied and analyzed data obtained about COVID-19 cases from various communities in Toronto specifying age, gender, and source of infection of the patient. I found that younger age groups are more likely to be infected in their household while the seniors are more likely to be infected in community settings. My findings can be used to identify circumstances in which outbreaks are less likely for certain age groups.

This repository is organised as follows:
Starter directory contains the readme, as well as the R project and a gitignore file.
The inputs directory contains a data directory which contains the data set used for my research.
The outputs directory contains a paper direcotry which contains my paper's r-markdown file, the pdf of the paper itself which is produced from my r-markdown file and a refreces file which contains all the references for my research paper.
The scripts directory contains an R script that I used to download the data used for my research paper.

To download data:
Goto the "scripts" directory and download "01-data_download.R" and run the R file, or goto "inputs/data" and download the "covid19_outbreaks.csv" file.

To see the raw R-markdown file:
Goto "outputs/paper" and download the "paper.Rmd".

To see my paper and results:
Download "paper.Rmd" from above and knit the file or download "paper.pdf" from "outputs/paper".
